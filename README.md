# Task Zero plugin for Obsidian

Task Zero is a keyboard-first GTD task management system for Obsidian.

If you’ve ever used [MyLifeOrganized](https://www.mylifeorganized.net/), the UI will be immediately familiar. I love MLO and used it for many years, and wanted a similar experience inside Obsidian.

The goals of this project are:

1. Reduce friction as much as possible.
2. Everything can be managed from a single interface on [the main task page](https://taskzero.alan.gr/the-tasklist).
3. Every action can be done with [keyboard shortcuts](https://taskzero.alan.gr/keyboard-shortcuts).
4. Other plugins and scripts can interact with your tasks [via API](https://taskzero.alan.gr/api).
