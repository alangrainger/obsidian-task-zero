# Task Zero plugin for Obsidian

Task Zero is an opinionated GTD-style task management system for Obsidian. If you've ever used [MyLifeOrganized](https://www.mylifeorganized.net/), the UI will be immediately familiar. I love MLO and used it for many years, and wanted a similar experience inside Obsidian.
